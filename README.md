## Step 4: Deploy the Website from GitHub to Apache

To host my custom Murdoch IT Hub website on the cloud server, I pulled the code from GitHub and deployed it using Apache.

- Connected to my EC2 Ubuntu server via SSH.

- Navigated to the home directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/prajethsv/prajethsv.github.io.git
  cd prajethsv.github.io
  ls
  sudo cp index.html /var/www/html/index.html
